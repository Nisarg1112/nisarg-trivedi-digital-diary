```

### 4. Environment Variables
- I've already added all the required environment variables in the `.env.sample` file.
- Or else Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following environment variables:
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_DOMAIN = "your-public-domain" // For SEO purposes
NEXT_PUBLIC_GTAG_MEASUREMENT_ID = "your-gtag-measurement-id" // For google analytics not needed necessarily

## Deployment

### Deploy to Vercel
1. Fork this repository to your GitHub account
2. Go to [vercel.com/new](https://vercel.com/new)
3. Import your forked repository
4. Vercel will automatically detect Next.js and configure the build settings
5. Add required environment variables from `.env.sample`
6. Click "Deploy".

Your site will be live at a `.vercel.app` domain within minutes.

### Custom Domain Setup

#### Option 1: Using Vercel as Name Servers (Recommended)
1. Go to your project on Vercel dashboard
2. Navigate to "Settings" ‚Üí "Domains"
3. Add your domain name
4. Vercel will provide you with name servers (usually 4)
5. Go to your domain registrar's dashboard
6. Replace existing name servers with Vercel's name servers
7. Wait for DNS propagation (can take up to 48 hours)

Vercel's name servers typically look like:
```bash
ns1.vercel-dns.com
ns2.vercel-dns.com
```

#### Option 2: Using A and CNAME Records
1. Go to your project on Vercel dashboard
2. Navigate to "Settings" ‚Üí "Domains"
3. Add your domain name
4. Keep your existing name servers
5. Add these DNS records at your domain registrar:
6. A Record: Point @ to 76.76.21.21
7. CNAME Record: Point www to cname.vercel-dns.com

Both methods will:

- Automatically configure SSL certificates
- Enable automatic domain security
- Provide DDoS protection
- Enable Vercel's global CDN

You can verify the setup by checking the domain status in your Vercel dashboard.
